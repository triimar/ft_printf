# ft_printf - Recoding the printf()

## Overview

The `ft_printf` project is a part of the 42 school curriculum aimed at teaching students about variadic functions and writing well-structured, extensible code. It involves recoding the `printf` function from the C Standard Library to gain a deeper understanding of its functionality.

## Features

`ft_printf` is capable of handling the following conversions:

- `%c`: Character
- `%s`: String
- `%p`: Pointer address
- `%d`, `%i`: Signed decimal integer
- `%u`: Unsigned decimal integer
- `%x`, `%X`: Unsigned hexadecimal integer
- `%%`: Percent sign

## Dependencies

`ft_printf` includes and utilizes the original version of the `libft` library. You can find the updated version of `libft` [here](https://github.com/triimar/libft).
